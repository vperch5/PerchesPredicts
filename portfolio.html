        <h2>Project 1: Basic Python: Entertainment Industry Analysis</h2>

        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this project, I worked with data from the entertainment industry, focusing on TV shows released during the "Golden Age" of television, beginning in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos*. The main objective of the project was to analyze how the number of votes on IMDb impacts the ratings of TV shows. The assumption was that highly-rated shows also tend to have more votes. This project investigates that assumption through data analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Instructions for Completing the Project:</strong> The project is divided into three stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stage 1: Data Overview</strong> — Analyze the dataset and provide insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 2: Data Preprocessing</strong> — Clean the dataset by addressing missing and duplicate values.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 3: Data Analysis</strong> — Analyze the assumption that shows with high IMDb ratings also have a high number of votes.</li>
        </ul>
